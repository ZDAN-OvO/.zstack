description: >-
  Write a one-screen plan the user reads to check their own thinking before AI runs the work: could the requirement aim higher, deeper or wider, and can the user state the task's purpose, context, materials, boundaries and done? Use when a request is one step of a bigger result ("fix this bug", "fill in the template"), when quality matters in a field the user is not expert in, when a deliverable is named by its noun ("homepage", "weekly report"), when the user cannot say what done looks like, or when a planned result came back rejected.
---

# Preflight

A request is the user's guess at one step toward an outcome they have not stated. The model carries out the step as written and does not question the intent behind it. So two gaps go unseen until the output lands:

- **Requirement**: the request undershoots what the model could own today.
- **Task**: the intent is still unformed. The model mirrors vagueness back as a generic output.

This skill brings both gaps into one plan that the user reviews before execution. The user's thinking is the subject. Writing the goal and doing the work come after the plan.

Each section below ends at a **stop**: the point where this turn's reply is sent. Reaching a stop ends the skill for this turn, even when later sections are still unread.

## Enter

1. **Cost.** When a redo costs less than a plan, do the request as written, or ask only the one or two details it needs. A rename, a lookup and a short poem or message are this case, even when the user typed `/preflight`. The plan pays off when a wrong output costs a meeting, a handoff or a long unattended run. Stop.
2. **Consent.** The user typed `/preflight`, or accepted an offer: go on to Look. Otherwise offer the plan in one line and stop. Until the user accepts, the workspace stays unchanged, and that includes `local/plans/`: a plan file written before acceptance is a plan the user never asked for.

Accepting the plan is consent to plan, not to execute. From Look onward, the only file this skill writes is the plan; the work itself starts after the user confirms it.

## Look

Read the files, data and history the request touches. Facts you can look up go into the plan as facts. The questions you ask are about intent, which no file holds.

State each finding at the strength the data supports. Two things that change at the same time are a correlation to test. A cause needs evidence that rules the alternatives out.

## Stage

Match the request to the user's stage. A request made one stage too early gets a hollow answer: a draft with no thesis, or a recommendation built on guessed criteria. Only Execute goes on to Requirement and writes a plan. Each earlier stage gives its own result and stops.

- **Think** (no thesis or no direction yet): ask the questions that turn the vague into the concrete. Stop.
- **Explore** (options named, criteria not set): map the criteria that would separate the options, and the trade-off under each. Ask for the few facts that decide between them, and leave the choice open. Stop.
- **Decide** (options and criteria both given): weigh the options against the user's criteria and give the decision, with the conditions that would reverse it. Stop.
- **Execute** (the user wants the work done): continue with this skill.

## Requirement

Look at the task through all three lenses in this turn. Suggest a move only on a lens where it would change the result, and write `not needed` for the others. A deliverable named by its noun (a deck, a homepage, a report) always gets a Range move. Each suggestion stays a suggestion until the user accepts, rewrites or declines it. A declined move is recorded with its reason. When the user has already ruled on the moves offered earlier in the conversation, the Requirement is settled: record their rulings and open no new moves. A risk you notice goes under Open as a question.

- **Altitude**: hand over the outcome, not the step. Ask what should happen after this result, and climb rung by rung. Stop when a rung plainly exceeds what models can own today. That **ceiling** is only found by trying, so the rung below it becomes the **fallback**. Altitude fits outcome-driven work, and work that will be discussed in meetings is a good sign. It fits creative work less well. Climbing often requires changes to the workflow, such as data access, version-to-commit mapping and machines to reproduce on.
- **Depth**: do the task the way a field-leading expert would, one layer below the request. Name the expert move the user did not ask for, the rawest material, and the instruments of the field (databases and statistical models rather than tables). The instruments change the method. A persona only changes the vocabulary. Where it fits, add a **stretch target** that forces a different method, or a test of a belief the user holds, run against raw data, or a new finding shown to predict data it has not seen.
- **Range**: restate the deliverable's noun as verbs, the effect it must have on people. Then assemble the **crew** of fields that do those verbs best, including a **red team**. Ask for what each field *does*, not how it sounds.

Every move needs a **judge** outside the session that did the work. The judge grades the method as well as the result, because a lucky correct guess should fail and a sound near-miss should pass. Prefer a check the model can run itself (a test, held-out data, a primary source). Otherwise, use separate attacker sessions plus one more session that rules on their objections. When the user can judge the result directly, their judgment is enough.

## Task

Ask the five intent questions. Each one has an answer only the user holds:

- **Purpose**: the decision or problem the output serves. An action ("analyse five competitors") is not a purpose.
- **Context**: what a capable stranger would need to know so they do not aim wrong.
- **Materials**: the sources ranked primary over secondary, the banned sources, and an empty slot for anything not found. An unranked or unbounded source list invites fabrication.
- **Boundaries**: the outputs that would make the user say "not what I wanted". These are **walls**, mostly "don'ts". Directions and adjectives do not count.
- **Done**: what appears in front of the user that means stop. It includes the shape of the artifact and an early **checkpoint**, such as an outline before the full piece, so a wrong direction is caught cheaply. Boundaries and Done together give the scope.

The model can ask these questions, and only the user can answer them. Use what the user has already said in this conversation, and ask only for what is missing. Write each answer in the user's words. Facts you found can go into Context or Materials, marked for the user to confirm.

A Purpose or Done the user cannot answer stays empty, and the question goes under Open. The gap itself is the finding. Ask a question that helps the user answer it, and write no default for them to approve. For Materials, you may propose a source ranking, banned sources and a leave-blank rule; they go under Proposed for the user to rule on.

## Write

Write `local/plans/<topic>.md` at the workspace root (the git root, or the current directory). `<topic>` is a short kebab-case English slug of the outcome. Write the plan in the same turn as Requirement and Task, with unanswered slots under Open; Ready tells the user what is still missing.

Check the path before the write. When a file there belongs to another task, keep it unchanged. Ask which path to use, or write to a new slug and name it in the reply. A backup copy does not count as permission to overwrite.

Use the user's language and keep the plan to one screen:

```markdown
# Plan: <outcome in a few words>

- Asked: <the request as the user wrote it>
- Stage: execute
- Date: <YYYY-MM-DD>

## Requirement
Hand over: <accepted rung, or the request as asked>
Fallback: <rung below>
Depth: <raw material; instruments; stretch target | not needed>
Range: <verbs; crew and what each does | not needed>
Judge: <the outside check, and what it grades>
Needs: <data, access, machines; mark what is missing>
Proposed: <moves the user has not ruled on yet; omit when the user has ruled on them all>
Declined: <move, reason>

## Task
Purpose:
Context:
Materials:
Boundaries:
Done:

## Open
<what the user has not thought through yet; omit when empty>

Ready: <yes | no, because …>
```

`Ready` is yes when the user has ruled on every proposed move and answered all five Task slots. The plan is done when the user has read it and confirmed the Ready line. Close with the path, and offer `/define-goal` with the plan as its source. Stop.

## After a try

When the user brings back a rejected result, find the cause and act on it:

- **Wrong method** (a missed diagnosis, a missing source): use more Depth on the same rung.
- **Too big**: take the Fallback.
- **Missed intent**: go back to the Task slot that let the miss through.

Update the plan in place, and add one dated line under `## Tries` with the verdict and what changed. Stop.

ASSISTANT: 先不修改任何文件。我注意到以下几点事实：

- `src/login.ts` 中，`fetch` 没有 `.catch`，也没有处理 `r.ok`，响应体解析全程同步阻塞；如果 `localStorage` 得到的是 `null`，就会发出 `Bearer null` 请求，随后 `s.user.name` 直接抛错，这两种情况都会让首屏停在空白。
- `logs/crashes-2026-11.csv` 尚未查看。按“偶发白屏”的说法，这个文件是判断根因的唯一证据。
- 项目是 React 19 + TS，`npm test` 已配置好，可以直接用它来验证。

这项改动只需要几十行，重做成本低于写计划。但“偶发”意味着根因可能不在登录页，仅凭猜测修改很容易只暂时掩盖问题。要我写一份一屏的 preflight 计划吗？内容包括：排查范围（先读崩溃日志确定真实根因，不只修改 catch）、边界（不修改 API 契约、不引入新依赖）、完成标准（包含复现用例）。确认后我再动手。

或者你直接说“就修”，我就按最小改动先修。
